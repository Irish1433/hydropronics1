<p>The wick system is the simplest hydroponics system mechanically, as there are no moving parts or electrical components. However, this system is not ideal for water-hungry plants like lettuce or tomatoes, as they might use up the nutrient solution faster than the wicks can supply it. This hydroponics setup works best for microgreens, herbs, and peppers.</p>

<p>1.Set Up a Water Reservoir:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Create a reservoir in a bucket or basin filled with water and hydroponic fertilizer based on your plant's feeding requirements. This reservoir will sit beneath the tray holding your plant and growing medium</p>

<p>2.Connect Wicks to the Growing Tray:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Connect one or two wicks through holes in the bottom of the growing tray. If you need to make holes in the growing tray, use a drill or screwdriver. The wicks will soak up water from the reservoir and draw it up to the growing medium in the tray.</p>

<p>3.Set Up a Growing Tray:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Set the growing medium in the tray, containing a seedling, above the water reservoir. Use a medium that won't drain too fast and will utilize the capillary action of the wick most effectively, such as vermiculite,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thespruce.com/perlite-definition-and-types-1902787">perlite</a>, and soilless mixes.</p>

<p>4.Set Up a Light Fixture:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're using natural light, skip this step. Otherwise, set up a light fixture above the growing tray. If using incandescent light bulbs, set them 24 inches from the plants. LED and fluorescent lights are not as hot; place them 6 and 12 inches, respectively, from the plants.</p>

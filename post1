<p>Plants have long been grown with their roots immersed in solutions of water and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/fertilizer">fertilizer</a>&nbsp;for scientific studies of their nutrition. Early commercial hydroponics (from Greek&nbsp;<em>hydro-</em>, “water,” and&nbsp;<em>ponos</em>, “labour”) adopted this method of&nbsp;culture. Because of the difficulties in supporting the plants in a normal upright growing position and aerating the solution, however, this method was supplanted by gravel culture, in which gravel supports the plants in a watertight bed or bench. Various kinds of substrates have been used successfully, including rock&nbsp;wool&nbsp;(molten rock that is spun into fibers), fused shale, clay pellets, coconut&nbsp;coir, rice husks, granite chips,&nbsp;sand,&nbsp;pumice,&nbsp;perlite and&nbsp;vermiculite. Fertilizer solution, often derived from fish or duck excrement or synthetic&nbsp;fertilizers, is pumped through periodically, the frequency and concentration depending on the&nbsp;plant&nbsp;and on ambient conditions such as light and temperature. </p>

<p>The fertilizer solution is composed of different agricultural or horticultural fertilizer-grade chemical&nbsp;compounds&nbsp;containing varying amounts of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium—the major elements necessary for plant growth—and various trace, or minor, elements, such as sulfur,&nbsp;magnesium and calcium. The solution can be used indefinitely; periodic tests indicate the need for additional chemicals or water. The chemical ingredients usually may be mixed dry and stored. As the plants grow, concentration of the solution and frequency of pumping are increased.</p>
